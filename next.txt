doing something with the peer response,
making sure that all responses send legit enums and not just random bytes
in order to make sure that everything is tagged and serialized properly
so that when u deserialize, you know the request type (which tells you
which handler to send it to / how to deconstruct the data


another question
should i have that `Client` trait?
i should keep the request/response functions though

how to make protocol trait functions take in data better

more pressing:
should requests be sent without directly awaiting a response?
should that stream stay open? or should the peer responding re-dial
the requesting peer each time? (so that the requester doesnt have to block)
then each request/response pair will be given an ID to keep track of which
response corresponds to which request
